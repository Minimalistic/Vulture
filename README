Vulture: A game engine using the Vulkan API


Requirements
====================

Linux:

1) CMake
2) LunarG Vulkan SDK for Linux (64-bit)
3) g++ (haven't tested clang)
4) Xlib or XCB (both libraries and header files)

Windows:

1) CMake
2) LunarG Vulkan SDK for Windows (64-bit)
3) Visual Studio (tested for 2015 only)


Environment
====================

Linux:

VULKAN_SDK=<path_to_lunarg_vulkan_sdk>/x86_64
VK_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/etc/explicit_layer.d

Windows:

VULKAN_SDK=<path_to_lunarg_vulkan_sdk>

- Update registry to point to Vulkan SDK layer manifests (the Windows installer
  should take care of this for you)
  

Building and Running
====================

Linux:

From Terminal:
1) cd into project root (same level as CMakeLists.txt)
2) cmake -H. -Bbuild
3) cd build
4) make
5) ./Vulture

Windows (using Visual Studio 2015):

From Developer Command Prompt (NOT the windows command prompt):
1) cd into project root (same level as CMakeLists.txt)
2) cmake -H. -Bbuild -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
3) cd build
4) msbuild Vulture.sln
5) Debug\Vulture.exe


Vulkan coding tips
====================

1) Enabling the standard validation layer is a great way to uncover bugs in
   your code during development.


Known Issues
====================

1) As of SDK version 1.0.37.0 the VK_KHR_display extension is not supported,
   which means true fullscreen is not supported yet.
